# question-generator
This app generates question from the input text. 

Creating an NLP app that generates questions from text input, including multiple-choice questions (MCQ) and subjective questions, is a great idea for a research project, especially if you're interested in machine learning and deep learning applications in Python. Here's a high-level outline of how you can approach this project:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
   - Gather a dataset of text documents that you want to use for generating questions. You may need to annotate or label these texts with questions and answers.
   - Preprocess the text data by tokenizing, removing stop words, and performing other text cleaning tasks.

2. **Text Summarization (Optional):**
   - You can consider implementing text summarization techniques to create concise summaries of the input text. These summaries can serve as a basis for generating questions.

3. **Question Generation:**
   - Use NLP techniques to generate questions. This can be divided into two categories:
     - **MCQ Generation:** For MCQs, you can use methods like Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify entities in the text and formulate questions based on them. Use algorithms to create distractors (wrong answer choices).
     - **Subjective Question Generation:** For subjective questions, you might need to extract key information from the text and formulate open-ended questions.

4. **Answer Generation (for Subjective Questions):**
   - If you're generating subjective questions, you'll also need to generate model answers. You can use extractive or abstractive summarization techniques for this purpose.

5. **User Interface (UI):**
   - Create a user-friendly interface for users to input text and receive generated questions. This can be a web app or a desktop application.

6. **Machine Learning Models:**
   - Implement machine learning or deep learning models for various NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition, question generation, and answer generation. You can use libraries like spaCy, NLTK, or Hugging Face Transformers for these tasks.

7. **Evaluation:**
   - Develop an evaluation metric to assess the quality of the generated questions. You may need human annotators to evaluate the questions and answers.

8. **Iterate and Improve:**
   - Based on the evaluation results, iterate on your models and algorithms to improve the quality of generated questions.

9. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy your NLP app to make it accessible to users. Hugging-face.
